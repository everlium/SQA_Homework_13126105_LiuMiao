#Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives
##Testing vs Defect prevention

The objects about them were different. For testing, it applied on code and for defect prevention, it applied on implementation. Then they were used in different development phases. Testing was used in testing phase and later, but defect prevention was used in req/spec/design and coding phases. The third difference was the general expertise levels. The testing was low and defect prevention was medium. What’s more, the problem type was also different. Testing often had the dynamic failures and related faults, but the other was negating causes or pre-conditions to pervasive problems. The last difference was about the cost. Testing needed the higher cost than defect prevention.

##Testing vs Inspection

The first difference was about the object. Testing applied on code and for inspection, it applied on design, code and other software artifacts. Then they were used in different development phases. Testing was used in testing phase and later, but inspection was used in all phases. The third difference was the general expertise levels. The testing was low-high and inspection was low-medium. What’s more, the problem type was also different. Testing often had the dynamic failures and related faults, but the other had static and localized faults. The last difference was about the cost. Testing needed the higher cost than inspection.

##Testing vs Formal verification

The first difference was about the object. Testing applied on code and for formal verification, it applied on design/code. Then they were used in different development phases. Testing was used in testing phase and later, but formal verification was used in design and coding phases. The third difference was the general expertise levels. The testing was low-high and formal verification was high. What’s more, the problem type was also different. Testing often had the dynamic failures and related faults, but the other had local faults. The last difference was about the cost. Testing needed the lower cost than formal verification.

##Testing vs Fault tolerance

The first difference was about the object. Testing applied on code and for fault tolerance, it applied on software system. Then they were used in different development phases. Testing was used in testing phase and later, but fault tolerance was used in in-field operation. The third difference was the general expertise levels. The testing was low-high and fault tolerance was high. What’s more, the problem type was also different. Testing often had the dynamic failures and related faults, but the other had operational failures in small areas. The last difference was about the cost. Testing needed the lower cost than fault tolerance.

##Testing vs Failure containment

The first difference was about the object. Testing applied on code and for failure containment, it applied on system with potential accidents. Then they were used in different development phases. Testing was used in testing phase and later, but failure containment was used in in-field operation. The third difference was the general expertise levels. The testing was low-high and failure containment was high. What’s more, the problem type was also different. Testing often had the dynamic failures and related faults, but the other had accidents and related hazards. The last difference was about the cost. Testing needed the lower cost than failure containment. The failure containment almost needed the highest cost in all QA alternatives.
