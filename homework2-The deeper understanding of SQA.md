#The deeper understanding of SQA
In the practical work, the defects are handled during the execution of QA activities. For the defect, we not only need to build a record that stands for the discovered problems, but also need to track and update the defects' state. Of course, not all problems must be resolved during the QA activities. For some errors whose priorities are not high, we may fix the problems in a future release. In this situation, everyone who is involved must agree to this decision and appropriate planning for future actions is needed. QA activities are integrated into every phase in the software process. If we use waterfall process as an example, the defect prevention is focused on during the requirement, design and coding phases. What's more, for the testing phase, we focus on defect removal and for the release phase, we focus on the defect containment.

As is known to us all, the software is a product and different people have different quality expectations under different market environment. Therefore, QA activities are not enough. We should meet or exceed these quality expectations through the selection and execution of appropriate QA activities while minimizing the cost and other project risks under the project constraints. We can summarize three major groups of activities in the quality engineering process, pre-QA activities, in-QA activities, and post-QA activities.
