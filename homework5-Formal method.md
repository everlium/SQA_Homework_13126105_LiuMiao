#About Formal methods
The idea of formal methods is a good example of a methodology that can prevent injection of certain detects into the software system. Formal methods include two concepts: formal verification and formal specification. The basic idea of formal verification is to verify the correctness, or absence of faults, of some given program code or design against its formal specifications. Therefore, the formal specification is a prerequisite for formal verification.  

When formal methods are used for software development, formal specifications are used upstream for requirement analysis and product specifications, and formal verification or analyses are used downstream to verify the design and code before additional verification and validation (V&V) activities are carried out.

#Model checking 
Model checking is an approach that can resolve the difficult and human-intensive formal verification activities. This approach automatically or algorithmically checks certain properties for some software systems. It combines algorithmic checking of propositions through execution with formal assertions stated as the propositions with respect to software systems modeled as finite-state machines.  

The model checker is a software that runs an algorithm to check the validity of the proposition. If it is checked to be true, a proof is said to be produced. Otherwise, a counterexample is given, much like a failed test case that can be analyzed further for defect fixing.
