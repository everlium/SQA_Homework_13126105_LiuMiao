#How to use DFT in synchronization testing

There are some defects in the CFT testing and in order to get much more correct decisions, we need to use data dependency analysis (DDA) and DFT which stands for data flow testing. The subject of DFT is the verification of correct handing of data relations which are used in DDA during program execution. In other words, DFT is the result-oriented.

In synchronization testing situations, all the data should be ready and then the next related data can be print as a result. For example, the function y is described by the x1, x2, â€¦ , xn items. We can see the several x values as synchronization situations. That means if some of the x values are finished early, we still have to wait for the other to finish before we can finish y. So in order to execute the correct handing in synchronization testing, we must focus on two points. The first is that correct result (y value) is obtained or appropriate processing is applied for given input x values. The second is the arrivals among x in all possible orders, such as arrived one by one or at same time. Therefor when we design the test cases in synchronization testing, all arrivals of x in all different arriving orders should be combined.
