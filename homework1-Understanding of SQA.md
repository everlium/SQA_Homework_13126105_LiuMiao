                         My understanding of SQA
SQA is the abbreviation of software quality assurance. Before we talk about the SQA, we should know the definition of the software quality firstly. Software quality is about the degree that software consistent with the explicit and implicit requirements which are defined in the document. It should not only agree with the functional requirement, but also agree with the performance requirement, development standards explicitly described in the document, as well as the implied characteristics that all professional software development should have. So the software quality assurance aims at getting these goals through a planned and systematic approach.

SQA is based on the software products and activities to review and audit to verify whether software is up to standard. Software quality assurance group take part in the establishment of plans, standards and procedures at the beginning of the project together and will throughout the whole project. In other words, testing is just only a part of the SQA. 

It is only my understanding of SQA. Because I never learn the course about SQA before, so the opinion may be one-sided. I hope I can get the clear understanding of SQA through this class.
