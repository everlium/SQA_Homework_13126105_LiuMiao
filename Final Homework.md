#How to ensure quality of a software system
The Software Quality Assurance Course had been finished. In the past eight weeks, we learned the knowledge of software quality assurance deeply. And now I know more about it.

Before we began the course, I thought there was no difference between software quality assurance and testing. But now I have the new understanding. Quality assurance is a process-centered approach to ensuring that a company or organization is providing the best possible products or services. It is related to quality control, which focuses on the end result, such as testing a sample of items from a batch after production. Although these terms are sometimes used interchangeably, quality assurance focuses on enhancing and improving the process that is used to create the end result, rather than focusing on the result itself. Among the parts of the process that are considered in QA are planning, design, development, production and service.

Quality assurance must be a part of the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) from inception through implementation. I once read a report and it mentioned seven steps to design the quality assurance.

1. Define Quality to Match the Needs
We should meet business requirements and achieve a satisfying user experience. It is known to us all that the application development team is not charged with unrealistically perfect expectations.

2. Broadcast Simple Quality Metrics
Highly visible metrics will keep quality top of mind for the entire team and expose when efforts fall short.

3. Fine-Tune Team/Individual Goals to Include Quality 
The benefit is that team members perform according to their incentives, making quality improvement part of their goals reinforces desirable behavior.

4. Get the Requirements Right 
Less rework means less retesting and fewer cycles, which greatly reduces the overall effort. So the managers, business analysts, user experience designers and architects should be taken more attention.

5. Test Smarter to Test Less
Focused on testing the most crucial and risk areas ensures that they receive the lion's share of test resources and that any bugs that slip through are likely to be confined to the least-important features. 

6. Design Applications to Lessen Bug Risk 
Simpler, cleaner designs result in code that is simpler, cleaner, and easier to test and rework—which means that the code will have fewer bugs and that those bugs will be easier to diagnose and repair.

7. Optimize the Use of Testing Tools 
Automation frees resources from mundane testing to focus on the highest-priority tests and increases test cycles' repeatability.

Testing is an important part in the life cycle. The design of test plan and test cases should follow some methods. We have learned a lot of theory to design the test cases which improved the efficient of testing. What’s more, the analysis of result also should be paid more attention.

I once was an intern of Beijing AdSage Technology Company and took part in the testing group to do some work to ensure the software system quality. This software application was a plug-in about the Excel. The customer used it to get the KPI analysis in different ads keyword and some other environment to improve the SEM (Search Engine Marketing). Now I can link the theory and practice together and know every step clearly.
